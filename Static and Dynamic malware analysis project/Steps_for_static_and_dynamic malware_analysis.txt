**************************** Static and Dynamic malware analysis using Hex editor, Hash my file, Virus Total and Procmon ************************


**************************************************** Static Analysis **************************

1) I first download the malware sample from malware bazzar.com
2) the malware is in .zip file.
3) After extracting the malware it uses the .pdf format.
4) To confirm the file extension I first check the file extension using Hex editor.
5) After checking the file I figure out that file is .exe executable file.
6) After that I use hash my file to get MD5 hash of the file
7) After getting MD5 hash of the file I check the hash on VirusTotal.
8) In VirusTotal 52 vendors flag this file as a malicious.
9) After further investigation on VirusTotal I figure out that it's a "Smoke loader" malware.

    Smoke Loader: It's a spreader, check-disk-space, and checks-user-input malware  and have a 
                  cve number of "cve-2014-6345"

************************************************* Dynamic Analysis **************************

1) To perform a dynamic analysis I create an sandbox environment using Virtual Box
2) First I stops all Windows security services (Windows defender, Windows update, and automatic updates from Windows  
   file registry) to understand the capacity of the virus.
3) In next step I open process monitor (Procmon) for few minutes to capture the Windows 10 process
4) In next step I run the virus executable file and start capturing the process in Procmon I keep it running
   for 5 minutes.
5) After 5 minutes I stopped the process capture in Procmon.
6) Before start analyzing the malware I create a filter in procmon for only seeing the process of virus (executable) 
   file
7) In next steps I check for registry process changes that made by the virus by highlighting only the registry button in 
   procmon and figured out

      Registry changes: This virus creates a registry key for the session, file system.

8) In next step I check for the file explorer process.

      File explorer changes: 
   
       1: I figured out that the virus create a  .mun file which is used for windows system 
          resources which is used by system-level Windows program.
 
       2: I also figure out that the virus also create many .dll files.

9) In next step I check for any Network activity by this virus file, After Analysis I figured out that 
   there is no network activity is performed by the virus.

10) In next step I check for the Thread Activity to check for any child process of the virus file

       1: I figured out that the virus file creates a child process of "WerFault.exe" which is 
          self destruct but the help of process monitor I can able to see those child process.

(This self-project helps me to understand how to successfully perform Malware Analysis (Static and Dynamic)).
